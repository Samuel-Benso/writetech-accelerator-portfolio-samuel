Setting up clear and accessible API documentation is essential for any project. In this post, I’ll share how I built a developer-friendly documentation site for the JSONPlaceholder fake REST API using Docusaurus.

## Why JSONPlaceholder?

JSONPlaceholder is a free online REST API for testing and prototyping. It’s perfect for learning, demos, and frontend development because it doesn’t require authentication and supports typical CRUD operations.

## Choosing Docusaurus

I chose [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) because it’s easy to use, supports Markdown and MDX, and has great features for organizing docs and blogs.

## Steps to Set Up

### 1. Initialize the Project

I started by creating a new Docusaurus site:

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest writetech-accelerator-portfolio classic
cd writetech-accelerator-portfolio
npm install
```

### 2. Organize the Docs Structure

I created folders for documentation tooling and API reference. Each endpoint got its own Markdown file, such as `get-user.md` and `post.md`.

### 3. Write Clear Guides

I wrote a **Getting Started** guide that explains what JSONPlaceholder is, lists the documented endpoints, and provides example requests and responses. Tables and code blocks make everything easy to read.

### 4. Add Endpoint References

Each endpoint page includes:

- The HTTP method and URL
- Required parameters and request body fields
- Example requests in cURL, JavaScript, and Python
- Example responses
- Error handling information

### 5. Configure Sidebars

I edited `sidebars.js` to organize the documentation into logical sections, making navigation simple for users.

### 6. Test Locally

Running `npm run start` launched the local server so I could preview and refine the docs.

### 7. Push to GitHub

I used Git to version control my work and pushed everything to GitHub for collaboration and backup.

## Lessons Learned

- **Keep it simple:** JSONPlaceholder doesn’t need authentication, so the docs are straightforward.
- **Use tables and code samples:** They make technical info much easier to digest.
- **Preview often:** Testing locally helps catch errors early.

## Conclusion

With Docusaurus and a clear structure, setting up API documentation for JSONPlaceholder was smooth and rewarding.  
If you’re building docs for your own API, I highly recommend this approach!
