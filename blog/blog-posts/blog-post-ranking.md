Publishing a blog is one thing. Making it show up on Google search is another. If your posts are not ranking, it means Google is not seeing enough signals that your content is useful, relevant, and trustworthy. In this guide, I’ll show you step by step how to make your blog posts rank on Google and stay visible.


## Start with Keyword Research

Before writing, you need to know what people are searching for. This is where **keywords** come in.

* **What it means:** Keywords are the exact words people type on Google when searching for something.
* **Example:** If you write about “Docusaurus sidebars,” people may search for “how to add sidebar in Docusaurus” or “Docusaurus config file example.”

**How to do it:**

1. Use free tools like [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/), [Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/), or [AnswerThePublic](https://answerthepublic.com/).
2. Find keywords with medium search volume but low competition.
3. Pick one **main keyword** and a few **related keywords** to use in your blog.

**Tip:** Place your main keyword in your title, intro paragraph, and meta description.


## Write High-Quality Content

Google loves content that answers questions clearly. Your post should be **original, detailed, and easy to read**.

* Break your writing into sections with **H2 and H3 headings**.
* Use **short sentences** and **simple words**.
* Add **examples, screenshots, or code snippets** if you are writing technical posts.

**Example:**
Instead of writing:

> “Docusaurus config file is a central place where configuration for the website is maintained.”

Write:

> “The docusaurus.config file controls your site’s setup. For example, you can set the site title, theme, navbar, and plugins here.”

This way, you’re clearer and also naturally including keywords.


## Optimize On-Page SEO

On-page SEO means tweaking your content so Google can understand it better.

### Things to do:

* **Title tag:** Put your main keyword at the start.

  * Example: *“How to Use the Docusaurus Config File for Sidebars”*
* **Meta description:** Write a short summary with your keyword.

  * Example: *“Learn how to structure the Docusaurus config file and sidebars.js to create pages that work without breaking.”*
* **Headings:** Use H1 for your title, H2 for sections, and H3 for sub-sections.
* **Alt text for images:** Add text that describes your image.

  * Example: For a screenshot of `sidebars.js`, alt text could be: *“Docusaurus sidebars.js file example.”*
* **Internal links:** Link to other posts on your site.

  * Example: If you have another post on “How to Install Docusaurus,” link to it inside this post.


## Improve Site Speed and Mobile Experience

Google cares about user experience. If your site is slow or broken on mobile, your post may not rank.

* Use tools like [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to test your site.
* Compress images before uploading.
* Make sure your blog theme is **mobile responsive** (Docusaurus already handles this well).


## Get Backlinks

Backlinks are when other sites link to your blog. Google sees this as a vote of trust.

**How to get backlinks:**

* Share your blog post on Twitter, LinkedIn, and dev communities.
* Write guest posts on other blogs and link back to your site.
* Answer questions on forums (like Stack Overflow) and link to your blog if relevant.


## Keep Updating Your Content

Google likes fresh content. Update your posts every few months with:

* New examples.
* Updated screenshots.
* Recent statistics.

**Example:** If Docusaurus releases a new version, update your blog with the changes.


## Track Performance

You can’t improve what you don’t measure.

* Install **Google Analytics** to see how many people visit your site.
* Use **Google Search Console** to check what keywords your post is ranking for.

This helps you know what’s working and what to fix.


## COnclusion

Ranking on Google is not magic. It’s about writing useful content and making it easy for Google to find and understand. Start with keyword research, write clear posts, optimize for SEO, and promote your work. Over time, your blog will gain authority, and your posts will start climbing the search results.

If you’re writing with Docusaurus, these SEO steps will make your documentation or blog stand out on Google.
