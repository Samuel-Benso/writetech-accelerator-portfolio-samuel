Starting with Docusaurus for documentation can be exciting, but it’s normal to face a few bumps along the way. Here’s a practical guide to help beginners overcome common challenges and get their site running smoothly.

## 1. Understanding Project Structure

Docusaurus projects have folders like `docs`, `blog`, `static`, and configuration files.  
Take time to explore these folders—knowing where to put images, Markdown files, and config files is key.

## 2. Managing Authors and Images

To show your author profile and icon in blog posts:
- Define your author in `blog/authors.yml` with a unique key.
- Use the `image_url` field for your profile picture. You can link directly to a GitHub-hosted image using the `/raw/` path.
- Reference your author key in the blog post frontmatter (e.g., `author: benson`).

## 3. Fixing Frontmatter Errors

Docusaurus expects specific formats:
- For a single author, use `author: benson` (not a list).
- For multiple authors, use `author: [benson, anotherAuthor]`.
- Tags can be listed as an array: `tags: [docusaurus, api]`.

If you see errors, double-check your frontmatter for typos or formatting issues.

## 4. Clearing Cache and Rebuilding

Sometimes changes don’t show up due to caching.  
On Windows, delete the `.docusaurus` folder manually or with PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .docusaurus
```

Then restart your server with `npm run start`.

## 5. Tracking Files with Git

Some warnings appear if files aren’t tracked by git.  
Add and commit new files:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new docs and blog posts"
git push
```

## 6. Organizing Tags

Define tags in `blog/tags.yml` for better organization and searchability.  
Use clear, descriptive tags that match your content.

## 7. Troubleshooting Sidebar and Content Issues

If you see errors about missing document IDs or sidebar links, check for typos and make sure all referenced files exist.

## Final Tips

- Read the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) for detailed guides.
- Preview your site often to catch issues early.
- Don’t hesitate to experiment—mistakes are part of learning!
