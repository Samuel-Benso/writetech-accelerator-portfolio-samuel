# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

Welcome\! This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**.

Over the course of this bootcamp, from **August to November**, I will complete technical writing projects across various domains‚Äîincluding API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3. All projects listed below will be completed and deployed by the end of the program.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm a passionate technical writer with a background in software engineering. I love translating complex technical concepts into clear, user-friendly documentation. This portfolio highlights the practical skills I've gained during the WriteTech Accelerator, where I focused on developing robust and scalable documentation solutions.
