Use GitHub Actions to automate your software development workflows, including continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates your build, test, and deployment pipeline. Create workflows that build and test every pull request or deploy merged changes to production.

## Key concepts

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Automate testing for code changes
- Detect integration issues early
- Maintain consistent code quality

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Automate deployment processes
- Standardize release procedures
- Accelerate feature delivery

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Automate repetitive development tasks
- **Reliability**: Catch issues in development
- **Availability**: Run workflows 24/7 on GitHub's infrastructure
- **Cost**: Free for public repositories with free minutes for private repositories

## Common use cases

| Task |	Description |
|------|	-------------|
| Run tests |	Automate testing for code changes |
| Build projects |	Compile and package applications |
| Deploy websites |	Publish updates to web servers |
| Send notifications |	Alert teams about build status |
