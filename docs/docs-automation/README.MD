# Documentation Automation Project

## What I Set Up
- **Vale** for linting Markdown content.
- **Lychee** for broken link checking.
- **Spectral** for validating OpenAPI specs.
- **Redocly CLI** for generating API reference docs.

## Rules & Standards
- Vale uses the Microsoft style guide for tone and grammar.
- Spectral validates OpenAPI 3.0 rules such as descriptions and no sibling `$ref`.

## Challenges
- Configuring GitHub Actions syntax correctly.
- Ensuring Spectral and Redocly versions worked smoothly in CI.

## What I Learned
- How to integrate linters into a CI/CD workflow.
- How Docs-as-Code practices enforce quality early in the pipeline.
- How AI and automation reduce repetitive manual tasks.
