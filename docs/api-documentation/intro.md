# API Documentation Project

This project documents the [**Chimoney public REST API**](https://chimoney.io/). It includes a Getting Started guide and detailed documentation for selected endpoints, all designed to be developer-friendly.

### Key Improvements

  - **Structured Endpoint Pages**: Each endpoint now has its own page with a consistent layout. We use **tables** for clear organization and **code blocks** to display requests and responses.
  - **Improved Onboarding**: The `getting-started.md` page is a single, concise guide for new users. It includes **example cURL requests** to help developers make their first API call easily.
  - **OpenAPI Integration**: An OpenAPI specification file was created. This "blueprint" helps automatically generate parts of the documentation, ensuring it is accurate and consistent.


### What I Learned

  - **API Documentation Best Practices**: I now understand how to structure API docs to meet a developer's needs, including explaining key concepts like authentication and request/response flow.
  - **Using Docusaurus**: I learned to use Docusaurus to build a professional-looking documentation site. I also learned how to configure its navigation and use powerful plugins to automate tasks.
  - **REST API Fundamentals**: The hands-on work with the Chimoney API strengthened my knowledge of how REST APIs work and the importance of clear, well-documented endpoints.
