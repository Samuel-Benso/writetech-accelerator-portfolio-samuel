# WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio - Samuel Benson

This repository serves as my official portfolio for the WriteTech Accelerator Programme. It contains all my project deliverables, including API documentation, tooling work, and other writing samples.

## About the Project

The core of this portfolio is a hands-on project to document a public REST API. It demonstrates my ability to:

-   Create structured, developer-friendly documentation.
-   Use static site generators like Docusaurus.
-   Integrate OpenAPI specifications for automated documentation.

This project was a great opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical documentation challenge.
