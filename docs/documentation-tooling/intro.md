# Documentation Tooling Project (Docusaurus Site)

This project involved auditing and improving the **Getting Started** section for the **JSONPlaceholder API** using **Docusaurus**. The goal was to create a clean, scalable, and user-friendly docs-as-code workflow.

## Improved Pages

- **intro.md** – Provides an overview of JSONPlaceholder and its endpoints.
- **getting-started.md** – Step-by-step installation/setup guide, improved for clarity.
- **api-overview.md** – Highlights 1–2 endpoints with examples and explanations.

:::success Improvements Implemented
- ✅ **Clearer Steps:** Rewrote long and confusing paragraphs into short, actionable instructions.  
- ✅ **Navigation & Sidebar:** Organized pages so users can easily find setup instructions and API info.  
- ✅ **UI Enhancements:** Added callouts for tips, accordion sections for optional details, and suggested spots for screenshots.  
- ✅ **Code Examples:** Added runnable examples for JSONPlaceholder endpoints using `fetch` and `curl`.
