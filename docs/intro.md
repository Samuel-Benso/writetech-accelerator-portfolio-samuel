# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

:::warning Work in Progress
This repository is still under development. The links that are presently working reflect the projects Iâ€™ve completed so far. Other modules will be updated as I complete them during the course of the WriteTech Accelerator Programme.
:::

Welcome! This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **[WriteTech Accelerator Programme 2025](https://writetechhub.org/accelerator-program/)**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I completed technical writing projects across various domains including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3, using modern documentation workflows, tools, and Docs-as-Code practices.

## About Me

I'm Samuel Benson, a Technical Writer and Documentation Engineer. I specialize in creating clear, user-focused technical content, and Iâ€™m passionate about improving software and API documentation for better usability. This portfolio showcases the practical skills Iâ€™ve built during the WriteTech Accelerator Programme, as well as my journey exploring Docs-as-Code workflows.
