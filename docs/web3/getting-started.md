Welcome to Uniswap V3! This guide will help you make your first token swap (trade) in just a few minutes. No prior experience with decentralized finance (DeFi) is needed.

## What You'll Need

1. **A Web3 Wallet**
   - Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (a digital wallet for Ethereum)
   - Create or import a wallet
   - Secure your recovery phrase (12-24 words) in a safe place

2. **Some Cryptocurrency**
   - For Mainnet: Buy ETH from an exchange like Coinbase or Binance
   - For Testnet: Get free test ETH from the [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)

## Making Your First Swap

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet
1. Go to [app.uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org/)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
3. Select MetaMask and approve the connection

### Step 2: Select Tokens
1. In the "From" field, select the token you have (e.g., ETH)
2. In the "To" field, enter the token you want (e.g., USDC)
3. Enter the amount you want to swap

### Step 3: Review and Confirm
1. Check the exchange rate and fees
2. Click "Swap"
3. Review the transaction details in MetaMask
4. Click "Confirm" and wait for the transaction to process

### Step 4: Transaction Complete!

- The new tokens will appear in your wallet
- You can view the transaction on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

## Understanding the Interface

### Swap Box
- **From/To**: Select input and output tokens
- **Price Impact**: How much the price moves due to your trade
- **Network Fee**: The cost to process your transaction (paid in ETH)
- **Liquidity Provider Fee**: A small fee (0.3% by default) paid to liquidity providers

### Settings (⚙️)
- **Slippage Tolerance**: The maximum price movement you'll accept (1-3% is typical)
- **Transaction Deadline**: How long your swap offer is valid
- **Expert Mode**: Advanced features (not recommended for beginners)

## Common Questions

### How do I know my swap was successful?
- You'll see a confirmation in MetaMask
- Your token balance will update
- You can check the transaction on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

### Why is my transaction pending?
- The Ethereum network processes transactions in blocks
- During busy times, it may take a few minutes
- You can check the status on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

### What if my transaction fails?
- You'll only pay the gas fee (network fee)
- Common reasons: price moved beyond slippage, insufficient funds, or network congestion
- Try again with higher slippage or wait for less network congestion
