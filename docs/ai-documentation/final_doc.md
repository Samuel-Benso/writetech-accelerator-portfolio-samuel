# LLaMA 2 Developer Guide

## Model Overview

LLaMA 2 is Meta's open-source language model with three sizes, each with different hardware requirements and capabilities.

### Model Specs

| Model | Params | VRAM (FP16) | Hardware |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 7B | 7B | 13GB | RTX 3090+ |
| 13B | 13B | 25GB | A100 40GB |
| 70B | 70B | 140GB | Multi-GPU |

## Performance

| Task | 7B | 13B | 70B |
|------|----|-----|-----|
| MMLU | 45.3 | 54.8 | 68.9 |
| Math | 4.1 | 6.7 | 13.5 |
| Code | 12.8 | 18.3 | 29.9 |

## Quick Start

```python
from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer

model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf")
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf")

# Generate text
inputs = tokenizer("The future of AI is", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

### Optimization Recommendations
- **Quantization:** Use INT8 or INT4 quantization for memory efficiency
- **Batch Processing:** Implement dynamic batching for throughput optimization
- **Caching:** Leverage KV-cache for multi-turn conversations
- **Hardware:** GPU with sufficient VRAM or distributed inference setup

## Safety and Responsible Use

### Known Limitations
- **Factual Accuracy:** May generate plausible but incorrect information
- **Temporal Knowledge:** Training cutoff limits recent information access
- **Context Constraints:** 4K token limit restricts long document processing
- **Bias Potential:** May reflect biases present in training data

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Content Filtering:** Implement robust output filtering systems
- **Human Oversight:** Maintain human review for critical applications
- **Monitoring:** Continuous assessment of output quality and safety
- **User Education:** Clear communication of model limitations

### Recommended Monitoring Metrics
- Output factual accuracy rates
- Bias detection across demographic groups
- Harmful content generation frequency
- User satisfaction and trust scores
- Performance consistency over time

## Licensing and Compliance

### License Structure
- **Research Use:** Permitted under standard license terms
- **Commercial Use:** Requires separate commercial licensing agreement
- **Distribution:** Restrictions apply to model redistribution and modification

### Compliance Requirements
- Acceptance of Meta's Acceptable Use Policy
- Implementation of appropriate safety measures
- Regular monitoring and reporting for commercial deployments
- Adherence to data privacy and security standards

## Integration Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate size based on performance requirements and hardware constraints
2. **Fine-tuning:** Consider task-specific fine-tuning for specialized applications
3. **Safety Implementation:** Deploy comprehensive safety measures before production use
4. **Performance Testing:** Conduct thorough evaluation on representative datasets
5. **Monitoring Setup:** Establish continuous monitoring and feedback systems

### Production Deployment
- **Infrastructure:** Ensure adequate computational resources and scaling capabilities
- **Latency Optimization:** Implement caching and batching strategies
- **Fallback Systems:** Design robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Security:** Implement proper authentication and access controls
