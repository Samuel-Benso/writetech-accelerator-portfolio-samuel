## Model Overview and FAQ

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is LLaMA 2?**
A: LLaMA 2 (Large Language Model Meta AI 2) is Meta's second-generation large language model, available in 7B, 13B, and 70B parameter variants. It's designed as a foundation model for various natural language processing tasks.

**Q: How does LLaMA 2 differ from the original LLaMA?**
A: LLaMA 2 features improved training data (2 trillion tokens vs 1.4 trillion), better safety measures through RLHF, commercial licensing options, and enhanced performance across benchmarks.

**Q: What are the system requirements?**
A: Requirements vary by model size:
- 7B model: ~13GB VRAM (FP16), suitable for RTX 3090 or better
- 13B model: ~25GB VRAM, requires A100 40GB or similar
- 70B model: ~140GB VRAM, needs multiple high-end GPUs

**Q: Can I use LLaMA 2 commercially?**
A: Yes, but requires a separate commercial license agreement with Meta. Research use is permitted under the standard license.

**Q: What programming languages and frameworks support LLaMA 2?**
A: LLaMA 2 is supported by major ML frameworks including PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face), vLLM, and various inference engines like TensorRT-LLM.

### Technical Overview

LLaMA 2 employs a transformer decoder-only architecture with several key improvements:

- **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA):** Reduces memory bandwidth requirements during inference
- **RMSNorm:** Layer normalization technique for improved training stability  
- **SwiGLU Activation:** More efficient activation function compared to ReLU
- **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE):** Better handling of positional information

The model uses a 32,000-token vocabulary with SentencePiece tokenization, optimized for English text with some multilingual capabilities.
