# Meta LLaMA 2 Model

This project explores how AI tools can support documentation by generating drafts, extracting key insights, and supplementing existing materials.

## Model Chosen
**Meta LLaMA 2** - [Meta's LLaMA 2 Overview](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)

A collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.

## Project Files

| File            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| model_card.md   | Manually written model card for Meta LLaMA 2 |
| ai_output.md    | Raw output from AI tools (summary, outline, and FAQ) |
| final_doc.md    | Polished documentation based on AI-generated content |
| prompt_used.md  | Prompt(s) submitted to the AI tool |
| reflection.md   | Personal reflections on improving the AI-generated content |

## What I Did
- Researched and analyzed Meta's LLaMA 2 model documentation
- Used AI tools to generate comprehensive documentation drafts
- Reworked the output to match high-quality documentation standards
- Created a detailed model card manually following industry best practices
- Identified gaps in existing documentation and filled them systematically

## What I Learned
- The strengths and limitations of AI-generated technical content
- How to refine raw AI output into production-ready documentation
- The critical value of manual oversight in technical documentation
- Best practices for model card creation and responsible AI documentation
- How AI tools can accelerate but not replace thoughtful technical writing

## Key Insights
- AI-generated content requires significant human curation for accuracy
- Structured templates improve consistency in model documentation
- Combining automated generation with manual expertise creates optimal results
- Proper documentation is essential for responsible AI deployment
